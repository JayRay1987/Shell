grep biscuspid seasonal/winter.csv

grep can search for patterns as well; we will explore those in the next course. What's more important right now is some of grep's more common flags:

-c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
-h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
-i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
-l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
-n: print line numbers for matching lines
-v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match

grep -c incisor seasonal/winter.csv

prints the number of lines with incisor in winter.csv

paste seasonal/autumn.csv seasonal/winter.csv

PRINT THE FIRST 5 ROWS OF SUMMER.CSV to TOP.CSV
head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv > top.csv

> redirects the head output to a file

| use pipe to combine many commands

wc - word count
-c - characters
-w - words
-l - lines

grep 2017-07 seasonal/spring.csv | wc -l
